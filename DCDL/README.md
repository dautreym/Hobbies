Yet another count solver for the french Des Chiffres et Des Lettres TV emission (hereafter, DCDL) !
This project contains a single file that allows you to solve DCDL count challenges
by inputing the total to reach and the list of values you can use to do so.

Since I just did it quickly to kill time, it is designed very simply with no hard optimization in mind
(yeah it's kinda bruteforce) though it is still efficient due to the input values being limitated to 6 numbers (as in DCDL count challenges)

To run this file, you only need to be able to run python3 scripts.
There is no other requirements.

The recommended way of doing so is to use the  main function at its bottom
Modify the total to reach as well as input values
Then save your file and run following command in a shell :
python3 solveur_de_comptes_DCDL.py
